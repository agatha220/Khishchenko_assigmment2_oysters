			<h2> </h2>
				<p>
					Americans consume 42.3 million pounds of oysters per year.  Our love of oysters, particularly served raw and chilled on a bed of ice, is undeniable. In 2022, NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), valued domestic oyster production at over $250 million dollars, with oyster production tripling from 2000 to 2022. 

	</p>

<!--Graf on alerts & illnesses-->

<p> The FDA has issued 22 alerts, advisories, and recalls of oysters from January 2022 through July 2024. These safety advisories and recalls identify documented and reported illnesses due to foodborne pathogens, as well as potentially contaminated oysters. This has resulted in 1,014 documented illnesses. Outside of FDA documentation, there have been multiple deaths and illnesses reported by individual states in the last decade. The true number of oyster related illnesses is difficult to document as most are not reported to state agenices. 

</p>


Although a variety of pathogens have been identified in these recalls, the most endemic is the norovirus -- a pathogen that happens mostly through food handling -- resulting in 95% of illnesses. However, in the case of oysters, food handling may not be the primary culprit in getting people sick. Environmental factors including rising temperatures resulting in higher levels of contaminated wastewater runoff, increased ocean temperatures, the complex nature of oysters themselves, and our multifaceted food distribution chain are all contributing to the prevalence of oyster related illnesses.

<p> Unless you are buying directly from an oyster farmer or know and trust your fishmonger, it is highly unlikely that your oysters are coming directly from the source. By the time the bivalve gets to the grocery store or the restaurant where it will be shucked and consumed, it’s plausible that many entities in our complex food system have been involved. Multiple sets of hands are integral in the process of harvesting, icing, packing, shipping, and distributing the oysters to their final destination. 

<br>

<br>

Rising temperatures are another significant factor affecting our water system. Oceans have a large capacity to absorb heat. Rising temperatures cause evaporation and increased moisture in our atmosphere. That extra moisture is being released in extreme rain events, resulting in runoffs from pastures, streets, and sewer overflows. Estuaries, where many oysters are cultivated, are in the direct line of these runoffs, as well as pathogens that runoff into our rivers and eventually into the oceans where they can get into the oysters. 

<br>

</p> “All that water is now filtered through oysters and guess what they’re going to catch,” said <a href="https://mentor-initiative.org/person/jan-semenza/"> Dr. Jan Semenza</a>, PhD. “They’re going to pick up some of these pathogens that are being flushed down from the pastures, from the impermeable surfaces in the urban environment, and that’s how they get into the food chain.” 

<br> 

</p> “Raw oysters can be an issue just because of the way they live," Semenza said. "If we don’t clean up our environment, it all ends up in the oysters.”
